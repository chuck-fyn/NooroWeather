# Nooro iOS Take Home Test
NooroWeather is a basic weather app built to the project specifications for Nooro's iOS take home assignment. It allows users to search the weather in the city of their choosing. 

## Installation Instructions
1. Clone the Repository
2. Open in Xcode
3. Run the Project

I have my API key included in the project so feel free to use it, or replace it with yours in the WeatherAPI file. 

## Closing Thoughts
This was a fun and simple project and I especially enjoyed the challenge of matching the provided Figma designs. The weather icons that came from weatherapi.com were of poor quality, so if I had more time I would have liked to find another source to download higher quality weather icons. But besides that I think I did a good job of matching the design files. 

If I had more time I would have also worked on providing more user feedback during any error handling, but for now I just have any errors logged internally. 

Thanks for the opportunity to submit a project, I look forward to discussing it with you soon!
